                    whatever
                    your preferred term is for someone working remotely from an exotic location. Westerners on their
                    laptops are everywhere, taking up table space in coffee shops or set up in one of the six separate
                    co-working spaces inside a two-mile radius. They might be a small segment of <span
                        class="underlin">the more than 5 million
                        people who visit Bali each year</span>, but they’re overrepresented in Canggu. There are
                    programmers,
                    entrepreneurs, marketers, scam artists, and, of course, writers like me. If a job can be done on the
                    internet, someone is doing it here.</p>
                <p>Canggu, a small beachside village on the Indonesian island of Bali, currently <span
                        class="underlin">holds the top spot on
                        Nomad List</span>, a website that ranks places around the world based on how easy it is for
                    people to work
                    remotely from them. It’s not hard to see why. The cost of living is low while the quality of
                    life — and, crucially, the internet speeds — are high. For about $1,500 a month, you can live in a
                    private en suite room in a villa with a swimming pool, hire a scooter to get around, surf every day,
                    and eat out for every meal.</p>

            <h2>How about indonesians ?</h2>
            <p>But this workers’ paradise in Indonesia leaves out one crucial population: Indonesians.</p>
            <p>As of 2017, Indonesia has the sixth worst income inequality in the world. <span class="underlin">A 2017
                    report from Oxfam</span> says
                that the top 1% of the country’s population control 49% of the wealth. Meanwhile, 8% of the population
                lives in “extreme” poverty (less than $1.90/day); 36% in “moderate” poverty (less than $3.10/day). The
                country’s economy is booming overall — but not equally.</p>
            <p><b>Gonan Nasution</b>, general manager of the <span class="underlin">Taman Nauli Boutique Rooms
                    hotel</span>, grew up in Canggu. He’s seen the
                area change from sprawling rice fields to a thriving tourist destination. “First the surfers came and
                then the yogis came,” explains Nasution. “And after the yogis, the fitness people came.” Now it’s the
                digital nomads, drawn to Canggu’s still-somewhat-authentic and affordable vibe.</p>
            <p>Since 2012 or so, new hotels, cafés, restaurants, bars, shops, and beach clubs have opened up every
                month. Former farmers now lease their land to businesses, the vast majority of them owned either by
                wealthy Indonesians (many from Jakarta, the country’s capital, some 600 miles away) or foreign
                investors. Rice paddy plots are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Construction is constant. People
                at the top are clearly doing well, though the workers under them — the ones facilitating the businesses
                that digital nomads frequent — may not be.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Indonesia doesn’t have a single minimum wage. Each district’s is set independently based on its relative
                GDP. In Bali as a whole, <span class="underlin">it’s 2,297,967 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) per month</span>,
                although it’s closer to 2.5
                million IDR in Canggu. That’s less than $180 per month at today’s exchange rate. According to Nasution,
                the workers in the coffee shops and co-working spaces getting the minimum wage are “living on the edge.”
                It’s enough for them to rent a room, buy food — and not much more. They’re living month to month,
                paycheck to paycheck. “Most of them work their whole lives,” he says.
            </p>
            <p>Bali’s hospitality industry draws workers from all around Indonesia, including Haren Tambi, the community
                manager at <span class="underlin">Dojo</span>, which is the largest co-working space and cornerstone of the digital nomad scene in
                Canggu. While the membership numbers fluctuate as people come and go, Dojo normally has between 200 and
                400 people paying monthly. The cheapest plan costs 800,000 IDR ($55) for 30 hours per month of access to
                the space, while the monthly unlimited plan costs 2.9 million IDR ($205). Tambi came to Bali about two
                and a half years ago from Sumatra after finishing his bachelor’s degree in accounting education. Within
                a few days, he was working the front desk in Dojo for a little bit above the minimum wage.</p>
            <p>“The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?” he says. “I’ve just finished my
                bachelors and now I’m mopping the floor and cleaning out the fucking toilets. This is what I get after
                college?”</p>
            <p>Despite the tough start, he’s only got good things to say about Michael Craig, Dojo’s Australian owner,
                and how he treats Dojo’s 43 Indonesian employees: “He’s a really good boss.” Dojo pays above the minimum
                wage, offers employees a big discount in the café, and helps them learn new skills, like coding. Within
                six months, Tambi was promoted to events coordinator. Six months after that, he got promoted to his
                current role as community manager. Things are a lot more comfortable for him now, although he still
                can’t afford to live the same lifestyle as some of his Western friends.</p>
            <p>“I can’t go to restaurants every day,” he explains. “I’d be bankrupt in 10 or 15 days.”</p>

        <section class="mag">
            <h2>Visa over KITAS</h2>
            <p>A writer who works out of Dojo, who asked to be kept anonymous to avoid visa trouble, says he’s been
                living in Bali for almost three and a half years. He came for six months and just kept extending his
                stay. Despite being here for so long, he’s still on a two-month tourist visa — although he sometimes
                mixes it up and gets a six-month social or business visa. All he has to do is leave the country once one
                visa is up and re-enter a day later, very few questions asked. As a “tourist” in Bali he doesn’t pay
                income taxes — he’s officially a resident in Canada and declares there.</p>
            <p>Other digital nomads I spoke with are in similar situations: They work from Bali on tourist visas, do
                visa runs to nearby countries as needed, and declare taxes in their home country. Not one had a KITAS,
                the official Indonesian work permit for foreigners.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a visa to travel, and it’s so easy for
                    them to come here.”
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While digital nomads aren’t paying taxes to the government, both Nasution and Tambi stressed that they
                are contributing to the local economy. They’re the customers in all the new businesses. While a local
                might spend 20,000 IDR ($1.40) on a meal, digital nomads can easily spend between 100,000 and 200,000
                IDR ($7 to $14). A lot of that money, of course, goes to the business owners, but some does go to the
                servers, cooks, and cleaners. They might not earn much in Canggu on the minimum wage, but it’s more than
                they would earn unemployed in their home villages.</p>
            <p>Without the digital nomads — along with the more than <span class="underlin">5 million tourists</span> who come to Bali each
                year — many Indonesians would be significantly worse off. Bali’s new businesses present an opportunity,
                both to nomads looking for a cheap, comfortable country to work in and locals looking for a way out of
                poverty.</p>
            <p>But the ease with which foreigners can work in Bali understandably annoys some locals. “These digital
                nomads are on tourist visas and they just have to leave the country every month or two,” explains
                Nasution. “It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a visa to travel, and it’s so
                easy for them to come here.”</p>
            <p>Tambi echoes his sentiments: “It’s hard for Indonesians to go to the U.S. It’s really, really hard. Some
                of my friends have family there and they still get rejected. They try again and they get rejected
                again.”</p>
            <p>Everyone agrees that something should probably be done.</p>
            <p>“It’s not fair to us who are working. We’re paying taxes,” Nasution says. He feels that there should be
                some kind of more expensive visa with background checks for digital nomads. “They need to enforce some
                tax or some rules for digital nomads.”</p>
            <p>No digital nomad I spoke to was against contributing more financially to Bali, and some believe it will
                inevitably happen. The writer gaming the visa system puts it this way: “We’re breaking brand-new ground.
                This movement is still only young. People are going to be working on their computers all over the world
                for many years to come.”</p>
            <p>Part of the problem is that the Indonesian government has bigger issues to solve. It’s the fourth most
                populous country in the world in the midst of major economic and social development. For now, digital
                nomads are living in a gray area — slipping through the cracks of a broken system not designed to handle
                people who can work from anywhere.</p>
